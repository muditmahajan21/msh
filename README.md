# MSH  

MSH is a simple shell implementation in C with few builtin commands.   

This is an ongoing attempt to learn about shell commands and their implementation in C while continuing the exploration of GNU/Linux.  

1. Shell accepts arguments separated by whitespaces and is capable of executing the system calls and a few builtin commands (cd, help, exit).  
1. Added builtin command (pwd) as well.
